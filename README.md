**Discord Notify** is a GitHub Action that sends build, release, or workflow notifications to a Discord channel using a webhook. It supports both simple text messages and rich embed messages, making it easy to keep your team updated on repository events directly in Discord.

## Usage

### 1. Content Only (Simple Text Message)

To send a plain text message to your Discord channel:

```yaml
- name: Send Discord Notification (Text Only)
  uses: niranjanshk27/discord-announcement@main
  with:
    WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
    CONTENT: "âœ… Build passed for PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
    EMBEDS: "false"
```

**Required Inputs:**
- `WEBHOOK`: Your Discord webhook URL (store as a secret).
- `CONTENT`: The message to send.
- `EMBEDS`: Set to `"false"` for plain text.

---

### 2. With Embeds (Rich Message)

To send a rich embed message (with color, title, and more):

```yaml
- name: Send Discord Notification (With Embed)
  uses: niranjanshk27/discord-announcement@main
  with:
    WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
    TITLE: "Build Status"
    CONTENT: "Build and tests completed for PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
    EMBEDS: "true"
    RESULT: "success"
```

**Additional Inputs for Embeds:**
- `TITLE`: The title for the embed.
- `RESULT`: Can be `"success"`, `"failure"`, or `"cancelled"` to color the embed.
- `EMBEDS`: Set to `"true"` to enable embed formatting.
